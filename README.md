Blogging Platform
This project is a blogging platform built with React.js for the frontend and a .NET 7 Web API for the backend.

Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a blogging platform where I can publish blog posts. The platform will also include a user authentication system so that only I can create blog posts. The frontend of the application will be built using React.js, while the backend will use a .NET 7 Web API. For data persistence, I will use Entity Framework with a code-first approach to manage a SQL database.

Planned Features
Frontend
Blog posts page: A page where all blog posts are listed.
Individual blog post page: A page for reading a full blog post.
Login page: A page for user authentication.
Admin page: A page where I can create, edit, and delete blog posts (accessible only after login).
Backend
User management: Handle user authentication (login, logout).
Blog post management: Handle CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for blog posts.
Database
The database will include three main tables: User, Post, and UserComment.

User: Stores information about users.
Post: Stores information about blog posts.
UserComment: Stores information about comments on blog posts.
Development Plan
Stage 1: Backend and Database
Set up .NET 7 Web API project: Create a new .NET 7 Web API project with the appropriate authentication method.
Design the database schema: Design the database schema and create the necessary models in the .NET project.
Configure Entity Framework: Set up Entity Framework for database management.
Develop the API: Implement the necessary endpoints for user management and blog post management.
Stage 2: Frontend
Set up React.js project: Create a new React.js project.
Develop the frontend: Build the pages for the blog posts, individual blog post, login, and admin.
Connect to the API: Use fetch or a library such as Axios to send requests to the API.
Stage 3: Testing and Deployment
Test the application: Ensure that all features are working as expected.
Deploy the application: Deploy the frontend and backend to a hosting service.
